# Basic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations written in C.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Double precision floating-point calculations
- Clean, straightforward interface

## How to Run
```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calc
./calc
```

## What I Learned
- Basic input/output operations in C
- Working with arithmetic operators
- Conditional logic with if statements
- Double precision math
- Handling user input with scanf

## Example Usage
```
A SIMPLE BASIC CALCULATOR: 
ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER: 10
Enter an operation to be used: +
ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER: 5
SUM = 15.000
```

## Note
This was my first calculator project in C. I later enhanced it into the [Trigonometric Calculator](https://github.com/alfredoeinsteino2024/c-trig-calculator) with advanced math functions.
